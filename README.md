# First Line is Title

Automatically set the first line as note title, just like in Apple Notes! Forget about manual filename entry or nondescript timestamps.

> [!TIP]
> The plugin is best used with the tab title bar enabled in Obsidian settings > Appearance > Interface.

## ⚡ Features

- Rename notes automatically or manually.
- Move cursor to first line on note creation.
- Put any first line content in title or headings only.
- Replace characters forbidden in filenames with safe alternatives, or omit them entirely.
- Strip markdown syntax from filenames.
- Add custom replacement rules.
- Automatically populate first line alias property — make forbidden characters searchable in Quick switcher or [Omnisearch](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=omnisearch), or set as note title in [Notebook Navigator](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=notebook-navigator) or [Front Matter Title](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-front-matter-title-plugin).
- Commands to batch rename all notes in folder, all notes with tag, all search results, or entire vault.
- Insert filename in first line on note creation.
- Exclude select notes, folders, tags, properties or filenames from renaming, or only enable renaming in some.
- Convert selection containing characters forbidden in filenames into valid internal link. Preserve original text in link caption.

## 🔏 File integrity

- Only notes that are currently open in the editor are processed, along with any notes you explicitly select for batch operations (like renaming all notes in a folder).
- Multiple safeguards are in place to prevent unintended changes but [regular backups](https://help.obsidian.md/backup) remain your ultimate safety net.
