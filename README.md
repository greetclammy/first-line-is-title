# First Line is Title

This custom plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) dynamically copies the first line in note body to note title.

- **It's recommended that you back up your files before using this plugin.**
- I don't yet plan on submiting this plugin to the Obsidian plugin gallery.
- This is an improved version of the [Auto Filename](https://github.com/rcsaquino/obsidian-auto-filename) plugin.

## üí° Tips

### New note template

It's recommended to use this plugin with a new note template that puts the cursor in note body on note creation, configured in [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) settings.

Here's the template that I use:

<details>
  <summary>Templater script</summary>

  ```js
---
created: <% moment(tp.file.creation_date()).format("YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mmZ") %>
tags: []
---
<%* 
if (!(/^Untitled(\s\d+)?$/.test(tp.file.title))) { -%>
<% tp.file.title %><% await tp.file.cursor() %>
<%* } -%>
<%*
tp.hooks.on_all_templates_executed(async () => {
  const leaf = app.workspace.activeLeaf;
  leaf.setViewState({
    type: "markdown",
    state: {
      mode: "source", 
      source: false
    }
  });
  await leaf.view.editor.focus();
});
-%>
```
  
</details>

### Commands

This plugin adds two commmands to the Command palette:

For the times when you want to force the plugin to update the title, I recommend to create the following macro with [Commander](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=cmdr) and bind it to Ctrl/Cmd-S:

<details>
  <summary>Screenshot</summary>
<img width="580" height="428" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-04 at 15 18 09" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de3f9062-045d-4f6b-9767-a8f023d4d0b6" />
</details>

This is super useful if you already use Ctrl-Cmd-S to trigger [Linter](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-linter).

## üî® Room for improvement

Though I don't currently plan on working on this plugin further, some potential improvements come to mind:

1. Opiton to omit markdown syntax in title.
2. Two-way-sync: also sync title ‚Üí first line.
3. Create custom CSS to make replacements for illegal characters appear the same as illegal characters‚Äîanywhere you can come across a note title.
4. Extend the illegal character mapping functionality to vault search and the Quick switcher.
   - For example, if `:` (regular colon) is replaced by `÷â` (replacement character) in file names, searching for `:` (regular) in vault search or the Quick switcher should automatically map to and match `÷â` (alt).
6. Add option to disable renaming file or folder in file and folder context menu.
7. Add option to rename file every time it gets opened (even if not focused).
   - Currently, if "Rename on focus" is toggled ON, the file gets renamed when it gets focused, not when it gets opened. E.g. if you open a file in a new tab without switching to it (if such option is enabled in Obsidian settings > Editor).
8. Replace the "Remove" button with [trash-2](https://lucide.dev/icons/trash-2).
9. Replace "Restore defaults" with [rotate-ccw](https://lucide.dev/icons/rotate-ccw) next to each replacement character.
10. Add regex support to custom text replacements.
11. Exclude folders via a folder picker instead of a text field.
12. Add an "Excluded files" section to the settings.
