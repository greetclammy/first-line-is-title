# First Line is Title

- This is an improved version of the [Auto Filename](https://github.com/rcsaquino/obsidian-auto-filename) plugin. 
- This is a custom plugin that I don't yet plan on submiting to the Obsidian plugin gallery.
- It's recommended that you back up your files before you use this plugin.
- I vide coded this plugin with Claude Sonnet 4.
