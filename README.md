# First Line is Title

Automatically set the first line as note title, just like in Apple Notes! Forget about manual filename entry or nondescript timestamps.

> [!TIP]
> The plugin is best used with the tab title bar enabled in Obsidian settings > Appearance > Interface.

## ⚡ Features

- Rename notes automatically or manually.
- Move the cursor to the first line on note creation.
- Put any first line content in title or headings only.
- Replace characters forbidden in filenames with safe alternatives, or omit them entirely.
- Strip markdown syntax from filenames.
- Add custom replacement rules.
- Automatically add a first line alias property — make forbidden characters searchable in the Quick switcher or [Omnisearch](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=omnisearch).
- Commands to batch rename all notes in a folder, all notes with a tag, all search results, or the entire vault.
- Exclude select notes, folders, tags, properties or filenames from renaming, or only enable renaming in some.
- Convert a selection containing characters forbidden in filenames into a safe internal link. Preserve the original text in link caption.

_Only notes that are currently open in the editor are processed, along with any notes you explicitly select for batch operations (like renaming all notes in a folder). Multiple safeguards are in place to prevent unintended changes or runaway operations, but regular backups remain your ultimate safety net._

## ✅ Installation
